After my highschool degree (Baccalauréat Scientifique Sciences de l'Ingénieur), I enrolled at l'École Supérieure d'Ingénieurs Léonard-de-Vinci (ESILV), La Défense to pursue a degree in engineering. During my 4th year, I truly discovered academia after joining the De Vinci Innovation Center (DVIC). I started working on my main project: ALFRED, a general purpose middleware for robotic arms.

With the goal to make ALFRED a polyvalent system, and to learn to handle the robot arm, I made an application that writes text and draws with the arm. My next step was to create an assistant, so I gave ALFRED voice recognition and language processing capabilities to make it able to interpret commands and communicate back.

During my 5th year, I worked on the software architecture of ALFRED, to make it faster, more efficient and more maintanable. I remade the entire system structure with docker and docker-compose, added databases, and my own robot control program.

For my 4th year internship, I discovered two other domains that I enjoy: electronics and MLOps. I created an embedded device for capturing photos and sending them to the cloud for analysis. I then used microservices to deploy a Deep Learning model to analyze the images and make decisions based on the results of the analysis.

All my projects made me realize my passions: creating systems that have a real impact on the real and virtual world, coding software made with deployment and multi-modality in mind, and engineering complex embedded and connected electronic systems.

After graduating engineering school, I intend to take a break from my studies by working for 1 or 2 years. After this break, my goal is to apply for and complete a PhD program in robotics, based on ALFRED.

I want to learn more about robotics, and push the field to realize my vision: robots working with humans in a symbiotic relationship, perfectly integrated with each other.
