# What is it ? üìà

Graph-it is a goal tracker, made of high quality, laser-cut steel, that can be hung up where it works best for you. It allows you to track your goals over the entire year by creating graphs that represent your progress.

# So, how do I use it ? üìà

To use Graph-it, you first have to find a task you aim to achieve every day. Let say you want to learn how to play the guitar. The goal is to create a graph with rubber bands, representing your progress throughout the year. There are 12 columns, for the 12 months of the year, and each column has 31 holes, one for each day of the month.\* Get your post-it note, and write your goal on it.

- Place a dowel in the bottom hole of the first column: this is day 1.
- Whenever you had a day where you played the guitar, move up the dowel to the next line. And keep doing this throughout the year.
- After each month, connect the dowels with an color-coded rubber band and see how your graph progresses.

# Can you graph more than one task ? üìà

Of course! Just use different color bands for different tasks. We will provide a set of post-it notes with the same colors as the elastic bands, so you can track as much tasks as you want.

# Why ? üìà

Many solutions exist for developing habits, but almost all of them are mobile applications that are either easily forgotten or bombard you with notifications. This doesn't seem very effective or pleasant does it? This is why we decided to get away from the digital world and create a physical, tangible product that can offer all the necessary features of a goal tracker.

# What does it consist of ? üìà

- One Graph-it 500x320x15mm metal board
- 50 wooden dowels
- 20 post-its of different colors
- A bunch of rubber bands of different colors

# How did we get there ? üí≠

We started with an idea of a goal tracker that allowed for 2 or 3 goals, tracked week by week. However, we realized that this doesn't give a good idea of progress and so we looked to expand the scale for the tracking. We decided that a year was a good time period, that made it so you could really see your progress.

Several designs that we explored. Once we settled on a format, we explored the finishes.

Voil√†! The final product was born.

# Why are we doing this campaign ? üìà

We are a team of 4 engineering students from the De Vinci Innovation Center (Paris, France), and we have time set aside to develop a product from design to shipping. We developed this project as part of our Quickstarter workshop with Oscar Lhermitte, co-founder of Quickstarter.As students, we have tested different types of to-do lists and we decided to make one that's more fun than those we could find.

# What are the rewards ? üéÅ

We have milestones for the number of Graph-its ordered, and each milestone unlocks a new color feature:

- Campaign funded: Graph-it in its base color.
- Every 25 Graph-It sold: add another color.

When each milestone is reached, we will hold a poll to decide which color will be the one unlocked, and when the campaign ends, you will get a message to choose the color you want.

# Where will the money go? üè¶

As the objective of this project is not profit, almost all of the money will go towards buying the materials and manufacturing.The unexplained costs are, of course, for our secret stash of instant noodles and expensive watches.More seriously, the goal of 800‚Ç¨ is to cover the costs of the minimum batch size from the manufacturer and the accessories. The price of one Graph-it was calculated from the cost of the base materials, manufacturing and Kickstarter fees.Though the goal for funding is 20 units, we are aiming to send 100 Graph-its around the world.

# What is the timeline from now until I get my reward ? üìÖ

- 11 February: beginning of the Quickstarter campaign
- 3 March: end of the campaign
- End of March: Graph-it orders placed
- Mid-June: all Graph-its are ready for shipping
- End of July: Your Graph-it is hanging in your home!

# Special thanks ‚ù§Ô∏è

A big thank you to Oscar Lhermitte for his advice on a design project, and sharing his experience with crowdfunding projects. The DVIC fabrication spaces helped us put together our different ideas and present them to the rest of the Quickstarter workshop.
